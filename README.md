# **ABOUT**
This project took me about 4 hours to make but is my favourite project i have made to date. This Anti-Virus offers you a free virus scanner and the ability to clean up your PC and much more.

# **HOW TO RUN**
You can either run the file by building it yourself or the easier method would be to run the exe file called 'RANO Anti-Virus' inside of either the debug or release file.

# **IMPORTANT**
This is very early BETA for this Anti-Virus so if there is not many options or some sort of bug it will be fixed swiftly and ASAP.
